       <p>Mark Zuckerberg is the CEO of Facebook, one of the world's largest social media platforms with billions of users. As a result of Facebook's success, Zuckerberg is one of the richest people alive - and one of the most influential. Facebook is everywhere, which means Zuckerberg is everywhere. Frequently under fire for the variety of issues that arise from Facebook's fame, Zuckerberg is regularly the subject of substantial controversy and conspiracy theories. He has repeatedly denied many of these conspiracies, but billionaires are rarely trustworthy.</p>
